<td><p><i>Lady Li was the daughter of a border guard. When the Duke of a neighboring state sacked her town and took her captive, she wept until her dress was soaked. But as time went on and she experienced palace life, eating fine food and sharing the duke&rsquo;s bed, she came to love her new life and wondered why she had ever wept.</i><p><i>In the same way, how do we know the love of life isn&rsquo;t a delusion? How do we know that by fearing death we&rsquo;re not like someone who merely forgot the way home? What if the dead, like Lady Li, wonder why they ever longed for life?</i> [Chuang&nbsp;Tzu&nbsp;2]

Without hesitating, Tanzan picked her up, carried her across the intersection, and set her safely upon the other side.</i><p><i>The two continued on, but when they had stopped for the evening, Ekido could restrain himself no longer: &ldquo;We monks don&rsquo;t go near women, especially not young and beautiful ones! It&rsquo;s a distraction from our prayers. Why did you do that, earlier?&rdquo;</i><p><i>Tanzan replied, &ldquo;I left the girl by the side of the road. Why do you still carry her?&rdquo;</i> [101&nbsp;Zen&nbsp;Stories&nbsp;14]

<td><p><i>A traveler once came to a river, its near bank dangerous and uncertain and its far bank calm and safe. The man collects sticks and vines and fashions a raft from these materials and, using it, crosses over from the dangerous side of the river to the safe side.</i><p><i>Suppose that traveler, after reaching the far bank of the river, said to himself, “This raft has served me well; I shall now carry it around on my back wherever I go.” Would he be using the raft in the appropriate manner? Of course not!</i><p><i>A more reasonable person would say to himself, “This raft has served me well, but is of no further use for crossing land, so I shall leave it here by the river and continue on without it.”</i><p><i>Similarly, all teachings should be used for crossing over and not for holding on to. You should let go of even the most profound teachings, and all the more so unwholesome ones!</i> [Majjhima&nbsp;Nikaya&nbsp;22]

<td><p><i>Off in the countryside, near the border of the empire, there lived a farmer who was known for being a righteous man. One day, without warning, his only horse ran off into barbarian territory. His neighbors all pitied him for his loss, but he said, &ldquo;How do you know that this isn&rsquo;t a blessing?&rdquo; Several months later, while working his fields, the farmer found that his horse had wandered back to him, accompanied by a beautiful barbarian stallion. His neighbors all congratulated him for his good fortune, but he said, &ldquo;How do you know that this isn&rsquo;t a curse?&rdquo; The farmer&rsquo;s family found itself a fine horse richer, and his son took to riding the stallion in the fields. One day, while doing so, he was thrown from the horse and broke his hip. The farmer&rsquo;s neighbors all pitied him for his loss, but he said, &ldquo;How do you know that this isn&rsquo;t a blessing?&rdquo; A year later, barbarians invaded the frontier, and every able-bodied young man was conscripted for the war effort, and nine-tenths of them died. Due to his injury, however, the farmer&rsquo;s son was spared. Thus can blessings become curses and curses become blessings; one cannot predict how events might be transformed.</i> [Huainan&nbsp;Tzu]

<td><i>A beautiful girl was discovered to be pregnant. After much harassment from her parents, she named her neighbor, the monk Hakuin, as the father. When her parents went to confront him about it, he only said, &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; The child was delivered into Hakuin&rsquo;s care when it was born. By this time, Hakuin&rsquo;s reputation as a teacher was ruined, but he nonetheless took very good care of the child. A year later, the girl could stand it no longer and confessed the truth: Hakuin was innocent, and the child&rsquo;s real father was a young man who worked nearby. When her parents went to beg Hakuin&rsquo;s forgiveness and ask for the child back again, he was willing. In yielding the child, he only said, &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</i> [101&nbsp;Zen&nbsp;Stories&nbsp;3]
