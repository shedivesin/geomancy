They noticed a traveler coming down the road, and Helios said, “I see a way to decide our dispute: whoever can remove that traveler’s cloak shall be considered the strongest.” So Boreas began to blow with all his might, but the harder and harder he blew, the tighter and tighter the traveler held onto their cloak, until at last he gave up. Then Helios took his turn, shining brightly upon the traveler until they were so warm that they removed their cloak willingly.</i> [<a href=http://www.mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/46.htm>Æsop</a>]

Could you please lend me some bread?&rsquo; And suppose he replies, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me. My door is shut, my children are in bed with me, and I can&rsquo;t help you.&rsquo; Even though he won&rsquo;t help you because of your friendship, I promise that if you keep knocking, he&rsquo;ll eventually get up and give you whatever you need! So I say to you, keep asking, and you will receive; keep seeking, and you will find; keep knocking, and the door will be opened.&rdquo;</i> [<a href=https://ebible.org/web/LUK11.htm>Luke 11:5&ndash;10</a>]

When the duke of a neighboring state sacked her hometown and took her captive, she wept until her dress was soaked. But as time went on and she experienced palace life, eating fine food and sharing the duke’s bed, she came to love her new life and wondered why she had ever wept. In the same way, how do we know the love of life isn’t a delusion? How do we know that by fearing death we’re not like someone who merely forgot the way home? What if the dead, like Lady Li, wonder why they ever longed for life?</i> [<a href=http://www.daoisopen.com/ZZ2.html>Zhuangzi&nbsp;2</a>]
