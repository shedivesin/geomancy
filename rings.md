These are the sixteen unique geomantic rings in lexicographic order:

These sequences, joined in a loop, contain every geomantic figure within them
and, in some sense, represent balance and the totality of human experience.

Be cautious of breaking the loop and delineating individual figures within it:
this removes the symmetry and causes the figure to become unbalanced.
