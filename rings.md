These are the eight unique geomantic rings in lexicographic order:

    0000100110101111
    0000100111101011
    0000101001101111
    0000101001111011
    0000101100111101
    0000101101001111
    0000101111010011
    0000110100101111

These sequences, joined in a loop, contain every geomantic figure within them
and, in some sense, represent balance and the totality of human experience.

Be cautious of breaking the loop and delineating individual figures within it:
this removes the symmetry and causes the figure to become unbalanced.
