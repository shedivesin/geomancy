De Bruijn sequences may be used to describe "geomantic rings:" sequences of
sixteen lines which contain all sixteen geomantic figures within them. In some
sense, then, these rings represent the totality of human experience.

There are two hundred and fifty six such strings, but most of these are
symmetric. There are only eight unique geomantic rings; and here they are in
lexicographic order:

    0000100110101111
    0000100111101011
    0000101001101111
    0000101001111011
    0000101100111101
    0000101101001111
    0000101111010011
    0000110100101111

These sequences, joined in a loop, contain every geomantic figure within them
and, in some sense, represent balance and the totality of human experience.

One should be cautious of breaking the loop and delineating individual figures
within it: there are only two possible combinations (barring symmetry) that
contain elementally-balanced figures:

    0010 1100 0011 1101
    0011 0100 1011 1100
