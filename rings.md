De Bruijn sequences may be used to describe "geomantic rings:" sequences of
sixteen lines which contain all sixteen geomantic figures within them. In some
sense, then, these rings represent the totality of human experience.

There are two hundred and fifty six such strings, but most of these are
symmetric. There are only eight unique geomantic rings; and here they are in
lexicographic order:

    0000100110101111
    0000100111101011
    0000101001101111
    0000101001111011
    0000101100111101
    0000101101001111
    0000101111010011
    0000110100101111

These sequences, joined in a loop, contain every geomantic figure within them
and, in some sense, represent balance and the totality of human experience.

One should use caution in breaking the ring into four figures: only a small
number of ways of doing this are elementally balanced, and further these
depend greatly upon the system of elemental correspondences that you use.
