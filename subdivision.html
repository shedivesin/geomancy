<p>Geomancy is often referred to as the Western <i>I Ching</i> because they both apparently utilize a binary form of cleromancy. I don&rsquo;t think this is correct, however. It is certainly true that the <i>I Ching</i> is based on a binary subdivision of the Absolute:

<table>
<tr><th>One Absolute<th>Two Polarities<th>Four Symbols<th>Eight Trigrams
<tr><td rowspan=8>The Supreme Ultimate<td rowspan=4>Day<td rowspan=2>Sun<td>Creativity
<tr><td>Joy
<tr><td rowspan=2>Dawn<td>Radiance
<tr><td>Awakening
<tr><td rowspan=4>Night<td rowspan=2>Dusk<td>Relaxation
<tr><td>Precarity
<tr><td rowspan=2>Moon<td>Stillness
<tr><td>Receptivity
</table>

<p>Geomancy, instead, is based on a quatrenary subdivision:

<table>
<tr><th>One Absolute<th>Four Elements<th>Sixteen Figures
<tr><td rowspan=16>Prima Materia<td rowspan=4>Fire<td>Laetitia
<tr><td>Fortuna Minor
<tr><td>Amissio
<tr><td>Cauda Draconis
<tr><td rowspan=4>Air<td>Puer
<tr><td>Rubeus
<tr><td>Conjunctio
<tr><td>Acquisitio
<tr><td rowspan=4>Water<td>Puella
<tr><td>Via
<tr><td>Albus
<tr><td>Populus
<tr><td rowspan=4>Earth<td>Carcer
<tr><td>Caput Draconis
<tr><td>Fortuna Major
<tr><td>Tristitia
</table>

<p>The reason this is so is because the symbolism of the figures is based upon the elements themselves, and not upon elemental qualities (such as hot/cold or wet/dry). So there is no sensible way to build the figures up line-by-line; they must instead be constructed fully-formed from the four lines in order to have any meaning at all.
